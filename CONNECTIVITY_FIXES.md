# Frontend-Backend Connectivity Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix connectivity issues between the frontend and backend components with LLM integration.

## 1. Frontend Environment Variable Handling

Fixed several issues with how environment variables are handled in the frontend:

- Updated `vite.config.ts` to explicitly define only the required environment variables rather than exposing the entire `process.env` object.
- Updated environment variable access in API services to properly use TypeScript casting and defaults.
- Added explicit logging of API configuration to help debug connection issues.

## 2. Enhanced API Service Connection Logic

Improved the API service connection detection and handling:

- Updated the `detectBackendURL()` method to prioritize environment variables.
- Enhanced the `testConnection()` method with fallback checks and better error handling.
- Improved WebSocket connection with timeouts, better error handling, and automatic reconnection.
- Added detailed logging throughout the connection process.

## 3. Connection Monitoring Improvements

Updated the connection monitoring system:

- Made connection checks more frequent (15 seconds instead of 30 seconds).
- Added "debouncing" for connection status changes to prevent false disconnections.
- Added multiple connection attempts before reporting a connection failure.
- Improved the status reporting to include more detailed error information.
- Initialized the connection monitor immediately on service creation.

## 4. React Component Updates

Enhanced the React components to better handle connection issues:

- Added automatic periodic connection checking in the EnhancedChat component.
- Separated connection checking from data loading for better error isolation.
- Added retry logic for loading models when the connection is established.
- Improved error handling throughout the components.
- Added automatic data reloading when a connection is restored.

## 5. Environment Variable Security Fix

Fixed the security issue in Vite configuration:

- Replaced `'process.env': process.env` with explicit variable definitions.
- Only exposed the specific environment variables needed by the frontend.
- Added default values for all environment variables to ensure functionality even when variables are missing.

## 6. Dependency Updates

Updated package dependencies for better compatibility:

- Replaced caret (^) versioning with tilde (~) versioning for more predictable updates.
- Downgraded some packages to more stable versions.
- Updated Python dependencies to use more flexible versioning.

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Run `./start_consolidated.sh` to start the system.
2. The frontend should now maintain a connection to the backend even if the LLM service is not fully initialized.
3. The system will automatically attempt to reconnect if the connection is lost.
4. Check the browser console for detailed connection logs.

If issues persist, additional diagnostic information will be available in:
- Frontend logs: `logs/frontend.log`
- Backend logs: `logs/backend.log`
