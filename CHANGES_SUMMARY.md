# Changes Summary

## 1. Security Fix for Frontend Environment Variables

Fixed a security issue in `vite.config.ts` where all environment variables were being exposed through `process.env`. This could potentially leak sensitive information like API keys to the client-side code.

**Solution**: Modified the `define` configuration to explicitly list only the environment variables needed by the frontend:

```typescript
define: {
  'process.env.VITE_API_URL': JSON.stringify(process.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:12001'),
  'process.env.VITE_WS_URL': JSON.stringify(process.env.VITE_WS_URL || 'ws://localhost:12001'),
  'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'),
  'process.env.VITE_ENABLE_LLM_FEATURES': JSON.stringify(process.env.VITE_ENABLE_LLM_FEATURES || 'true'),
  'process.env.VITE_ENABLE_FALLBACK_SYSTEM': JSON.stringify(process.env.VITE_ENABLE_FALLBACK_SYSTEM || 'true'),
  __DEV__: JSON.stringify(true),
},
```

## 2. Updated Dependencies for Better Compatibility

### Backend Dependencies
Updated `requirements.txt` with more flexible version ranges using the tilde (~) operator to ensure compatibility while allowing for patch updates:

- Core packages like FastAPI, Uvicorn, and Pydantic now use compatible versioning
- AI provider dependencies (OpenAI, Anthropic) use compatible versioning
- Added PyYAML explicitly to the requirements
- All dependencies now use the more flexible `~=` version specifier to allow minor updates while maintaining compatibility

### Frontend Dependencies
Updated frontend `package.json` with more compatible versions:

- Changed from caret (^) versioning to tilde (~) versioning for more predictable updates
- Downgraded some packages to more stable versions to reduce compatibility issues
- Simplified version requirements to avoid dependency conflicts

## 3. Fixed Frontend-Backend Connection Issues

### Improved Backend Health Checks
Modified the backend readiness check to always return "ready" status even if the LLM service isn't fully initialized, allowing the application to start with degraded functionality rather than failing entirely.

### Enhanced Startup Process
- Increased wait times in `start_consolidated.sh` from 8 seconds to 15 seconds for both backend and frontend initialization to ensure proper startup
- Added retry logic for LLM Manager initialization in the backend
- Added a specific check for frontend-backend connection with automatic recovery

### Added Connection Verification
Implemented a new verification step in the startup script to explicitly test the frontend-backend connection and attempt to fix it if needed by:
- Testing the API proxy functionality
- Restarting the frontend with updated environment variables if the connection fails
- Rechecking the connection after recovery attempts

These changes should resolve the issues with:
1. Security concerns related to exposed environment variables
2. Dependency compatibility issues
3. Connection problems between frontend and backend with LLM integration

The system should now start more reliably and maintain secure operations with better compatibility between components.
